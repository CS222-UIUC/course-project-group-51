Summary: Our project was designed to help users with a more efficient search for apartments in the area. We made this project because we personally had struggles searching apartments and want to help others who might have similar problems.
Technical Architecture: 
Front end: Used JavaScript, CSS, and HTML to  display information on our project (Samantha, Sam)
Back end: Web Scraping using Python to gather information (Max, Adelia)
Installation Instructions: You can download our project from our GitHub and will have all the files necessary to search for yourself. If you want to reproduce our project for a different area/town, you can follow the same framework we used and find information in your own area.
